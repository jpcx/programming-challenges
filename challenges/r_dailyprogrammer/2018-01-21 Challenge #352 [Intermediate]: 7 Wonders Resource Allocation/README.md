# Description

In the board game 7 Wonders, there are four basic resources, which we'll abbreviate with letters: W for wood, B for brick, S for stone, and O for ore.

Resource cards let you produce *one* of your choice of resources. We'll use W/B to represent a resource card that can give you *either* 1 wood or 1 brick, but not both.

Given the resource cards W/B/S/O, W, S/B, and S, it is possible for you to produce 2 wood and 2 stone: use the first two cards to get wood, and the last two to get stone. However, with that same set of cards, it is impossible for you to produce 2 wood and 2 brick.

# Input

You'll be given a comma-separated sequence of cards inside of square brackets, with the features separated by a slash. Your target will be given as "Can you make ____?" with the list of resources to target, one per card. 

Note: in the game 7 Wonders, every card produces either 1, 2, or all 4 of the resources. But if you want a challenge, make your program support any number of resources instead of just W,B,S,O, and make your program accept arbitrary resource cards.

# Output

Whether it is possible to generate the desired resources, and if so, how.
