A [Kolakoski sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolakoski_sequence)
([A000002](https://oeis.org/A000002)) is an infinite sequence of symbols
{1, 2} that is its own run-length encoding. It alternates between "runs"
of symbols. The sequence begins:

    12211212212211211221211212211...

The first three symbols of the sequence are 122, which are the output of
the first two iterations. After this, on the *i*-th iteration read the
value *x[i]* of the output (one-indexed). If *i* is odd, output *x[i]*
copies of the number 1. If *i* is even, output *x[i]* copies of the
number 2.

There is an unproven conjecture that the density of 1s in the sequence
is 1/2 (50%). In today's challenge we'll be searching for numerical
evidence of this by tallying the ratio of 1s and 2s for some initial *N*
symbols of the sequence.

# Input Description

As input you will receive the number of outputs to generate and tally.

# Output Description

As output, print the ratio of 1s to 2s in the first *n* symbols.

# Sample Input

    10
    100
    1000

# Sample Output

    5:5
    49:51
    502:498

# Challenge Input

    1000000
    100000000

# Bonus Input

    1000000000000
    100000000000000

# Bonus Hints

Since computing the next output in the sequence depends on previous
outputs, a naive brute force approach requires O(n) space. For the last
bonus input, this would amount to TBs of data, even if using only 1 bit
per symbol. Fortunately there are smarter ways to compute the sequence
([1](http://www.emis.ams.org/journals/JIS/VOL15/Nilsson/nilsson5.pdf),
