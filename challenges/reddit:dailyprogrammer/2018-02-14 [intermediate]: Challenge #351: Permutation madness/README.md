# Description

Permutation madness

A group of programs has gotten together in a line and have started dancing

They appear to have 3 dance moves.

- Try **Spin** that's a good trick, the right end swaps up most left keeing their order

- **Exchange** Two programs appear to swap depending on the numbers given

- **Partner** Two programs that know eachother swaps

# Input description

a list of programs in their initial order

First you will be given a string of characters, each character is an individual program

On the next line you will get a list of moves split by ,

The moves work as following:

- Spin is given as SN where N is a positive integer. This moves N programs from the right up front, keeping their order

- Exchange is given as xA/B where A and B are the positions of two programs that will swap positions

- Partner is given as pA/B where A and B refer to the original positions of the programs and swaps them whereever they currently are

# Output description

The output is the final order the list of programs stand in after they are done dancing

# Input example

    abcde
    s1,x3/4,p4/1

Everything is 0 indexed

# Output example

    abcde (initial)
	eabcd (s1)
	eabdc (x3/4)
	baedc (p4/1)
	
You only have to return the final state

# Challenge Input

    s1,x3/4,p4/1
